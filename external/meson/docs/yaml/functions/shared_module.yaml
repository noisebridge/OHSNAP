  Builds a shared module with the given sources.

  This is useful for building modules that will be `dlopen()`ed and
  hence may contain undefined symbols that will be provided by the
  library that is loading it.

  If you want the shared module to be able to refer to functions and
  variables defined in the [[executable]] it is loaded by,
  you will need to set the `export_dynamic` argument of the executable to
  `true`.
